<HEAD>Opposition Leader Faces Court Appearance</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Opposition leader Louis Dejoie was
summoned to court next week for a hearing apparently related to his
arrest on charges of inciting the public to revolt, a Dejoie aide
said Friday.
   Aide Philippe Stevenson said Dejoie's lawyer had mistakenly
informed him that the hearing was Friday.
   Stevenson said that Dejoie went to the Palace of Justice Friday
morning, but was informed by court officials that his hearing was
not until Thursday.
   ``I think it will be just to close his case since he was
officially in provisional liberty,'' Stevenson said.
   Neither Dejoie's lawyer, Georges Leger, nor Dejoie could be
reached at their homes for comment.
   Dejoie was arrested Jan. 20 when he returned from a monthlong
trip to the United States, Canada and the West Indies. During the
trip he called for an economic boycott of Haiti to protest the
aborted Nov. 29 election and government-run elections Jan. 17.
   Dejoie was charged with inciting the public to riot and held for
two days before his release.
   The Nov. 27 elections, which were run by an independent
Electoral Council, were canceled after thugs killed 34 people and
wounded 76. Witnesses said the army did not stop the violence and
in some cases participated in it.
   President Leslie Manigat won a Jan. 17 election that was
boycotted by the major candidates from the Nov. 27 balloting.
Turnout was low and there was no secret ballot.

   Six Cuban prisoners became unruly during a
cell transfer Friday, and three officers and an inmate suffered
minor injuries in the fracas, authorities said.
   The six began ``ranting and raving and throwing things,'' said
Sheriff Aubrey Cole. He said the inmates were not trying to escape.
   The prisoners, who are being housed by the county for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, were being taken to
separate cells when they jumped some jailers and officers, Cole
said.
   ``When they opened the cell and moved them out into the hallway
they began to fight the officers,'' Cole said.
   Dispatcher David Weaver, Deputy Jack Myers, and jailer Eddie
Johnson suffered minor injuries, Cole said. An inmate also was
bruised. No medical treatment was needed, Cole said.
   All six prisoners will be charged with assault on peace officers
and will be returned to the custody of the INS, Cole said.
   Cole said the sheriff's department called the Jasper Police
Department for help.
   A subsequent search of the prisoners' cell uncovered two
homemade weapons that had been fashioned from metal electrical
switch plates taken from the walls, sharpened and wrapped at one
end with cloth, Cole said.
   Five Cuban nationals escaped from the jail in October. All five
were later apprehended.

   Stage director Yuri Lyubimov, who has been called
the Soviet Union's greatest theatrical figure, says he misses his
homeland but welcomes the changes going on there since he was
exiled four years ago.
   ``I miss my theater, my friends and my relatives, but if I want
snow I can always go to Canada or Chicago or call on Solzhenitsyn
in Vermont,'' he said in an interview at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden.
   ``I also miss the unique Soviet audiences who hunger for
something spiritual,'' said Lyubimov, among the world's outstanding
directors.
   Lyubimov, a youthful 70, this year became a citizen of Israel.
He lives in Jerusalem with his Hungarian wife, Katalin, and son,
Peter. Another son, Nikita, is in Moscow.
   Lyubimov talked to The Associated Press on Wednesday night at
the stage door after an applauded revival of his production of
``Jenufa'' by Czech composer Leos Janacek.
   ``Jenufa'' was first produced in 1904 and is a dark tale of
peasant life, murder and penance.
   Lyuibmov ran Moscow's defiant Taganka Theater and was on a
London visit to direct a play in March 1984 when he became came
under criticism from then-leader Konstantin Chernenko.
   ``I was told I wouldn't be allowed to return home _ Chernenko
was half alive at the time and dead 12 months later,'' the director
recalled, speaking through an interpreter.
   Lyubimov said he's hopeful that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies of greater openness on selected subjects will
last.
   ``A lot of things once forbidden are now being seen in the
Soviet Union _ films, plays and books,'' he said. ``It would be a
terrible tragedy if all this will be reversed, like it was once
before when (Nikita) Khrushchev was deposed.
   ``But people coming from Russia tell me they really believe the
change is irreversible and I hope all people of good will in the
West will help,'' he said.
   The director said his name, in oblivion after his exile, has
been restored by public demand to the Taganka Theater's programs
for revivals of his celebrated productions.
   Lyubimov said the Soviet and Israeli political climates are
``very different and I'm trying to reconcile them.''
   The Royal Opera disclosed it has Lyubimov working on a new
production of Richard Wagner's demanding four-opera ``Ring'' cycle
for opening in September.
   Wagner, a German composer of genius, is anathema to many Jews
who regard him as an anti-Semite. Wagner's music has been shouted
down at concerts in Israel.
   ``Wagner is also little performed in the Soviet Union,''
Lyubimov said. ``I once wanted to to use the march from (Wagner's)
`Twilight of the Gods' in a festival music program, but it was
forbidden.''
   The ``Ring'' is performed in a variety of costumes these days,
from Viking style to modern evening dress. Lyubimov, when asked if
his version will be traditional or modern, replied: ``I'm keeping
that a secret, but I will try to use different kinds of symbolism
and psychological concepts to bring Wagner closer to the people.''
   He said he was glad to be working on it with Bernard Haitink,
the Royal Opera's recently appointed music director from Holland.
   ``Wagner's world is difficult to penetrate as he sought unity of
all the forms, music and drama, and wrote a lot about it. The hard
part about producing Wagner is that what you see on the stage must
not destroy what you hear,'' the director said.

<DATELINE>KIRYAT ARBA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a Beretta pistol in
her lap, Tzip Haetzni pulled her car out of this hilltop community
and joined a convoy of Jewish settlers on patrol under the stars.
   Her husband, Eliakim, an attorney, sat beside her, also armed.
   After nine weeks of unrest in the occupied territories and two
serious attacks on Jewish settlers, residents of Kiryat Arba, 20
miles south of Jerusalem, have begun nightly patrols.
   ``We shall not be chased from this place,'' Haetzni, 62, vowed
as his wife steered the car past an Arab refugee camp. ``We shall
meet the danger. We will fight darkness by lighting up the night.''
   But these tactics, while carried out by only a minority of the
West Bank's 65,000 Jewish settlers, have triggered panic and
sometimes fueled new violence.
   In the Arab village of Beit Ummar this week, a report of
approaching settlers sounded from a mosque loudspeaker. It was a
false report, but hundreds of Palestinians fearing a vigilante
attack rushed to the village outskirts, armed with sticks and
stones.
   Israeli soldiers who knew nothing of the false report tried to
force the Arabs back. Three villagers were killed in the clash, the
army said.
   In other Arab towns and refugee camps, Palestinians patrol their
neighborhoods through the night, looking for vigilantes.
   ``The Arab inciters have begun shouting, `The settlers are
coming! The settlers are coming!' to get everyone stirred up,''
said Mrs. Haetzni, 60.
   ``But the rumors are false,'' she said. ``We want to make our
presence felt on the road. We want the Arabs to know we are here.
But most of us are happy to let the army do the fighting.''
   Nevertheless, Kiryat Arba residents say some of their men
entered the nearby village o Hebron one night and smashed windows
of Arab-owned cars. Some settlers have also distributed leaflets in
Arab villages threatening retaliation against inciters of violence.
   Still, the relationship between most Israeli soldiers and
settlers is better than ever.
   With more than 100 troops stationed round-the-clock along the
road from Kiryat Arba to Jerusalem and a spotlight sweeping
continuously over a nearby refugee camp, many settlers feel the
army is finally doing its job.
   ``Before, it was like a toy army here, so we had to protect
ourselves,'' Haetzni said. ``We never would have reached this stage
if the army had been stronger earlier. But at least they are acting
now.''
   In an effort to help cement their new relationship, the
settlers' three-car convoy took coffee, cake and sunflower seeds to
troops guarding the road overnight.
   The convoy stopped outside the nearby village of Beit Ummar, a
closed military area, where two dozen soldiers stood outside a
Palestinian home while Arab children peered from the window above.
   One soldier wore a checkered Arab headdress wrapped around his
face for warmth.
   Pvt. Rafi, who would give only his first name in keeping with
military regulations, said the army has warmed to the presence of
the settlers in the area.
   ``We don't mind if they patrol the roads,'' he said. ``We and
they are the same people, even if we don't always see eye-to-eye
politically.''
   Not all Israelis agree. Some say the settlers are a source of
provocation, not protection. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has
called them ``a heavy burden.''
   ``The appearance of armed settler patrols alongside Israeli army
forces creates the impression that the state of Israel is
encouraging Jews in a war against the Arabs,'' the daily Haaretz
wrote this week.
   ``The Israeli army does not operate according to Jewish tribal
feelings, and the farther it distances itself (from the settlers)
... the better.''
   But Haetzni argues: ``Those Israelis who don't understand our
presence here also don't understand the Arab mentality.''
   Haetzni came to Israel from Germany at the age of 13. He built a
lucrative law practice in Tel Aviv and then gave it up to move to
Kiryat Arab 16 years ago.
   He recalls being beaten up as a boy in Germany because he was
Jewish and says, ``it helped make me a better, more realistic
Zionist today.''
   ``What Israelis don't realize is the Arabs do not want a state
on this side of the green line,'' he said, referring to the
pre-1967 border of Israel. ``They want a state that extends all the
way to the blue line,'' the Mediterranean Sea.

<HEAD>Lutheran Church A Rallying Point For Pressure For Change In East
Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A drab Lutheran church in East Berlin has become
the headquarters of a grassroots movement aimed at forcing reform
upon the country's aging and authoritarian Communist leadership.
   But unlike dissident movements of the past, the Lutheran
movement has found itself looking more East than West for
inspiration on how to change Eastern Europe's most industrialized
country.
   ``We want to change the system from within. We need to get some
glasnost here,'' a leading church member Hans Mayer said in
reference to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness
and reform.
   ``You can only get democracy when you fight for it,'' said
Mayer, who used an alias to protect himself from official reprisals.
   While the Zion Church is the headquarters and focal point for
the reform movement, other Lutheran churches in East Berlin also
have become rallying places for young adults seeking change.
   Dissidents were thrust into international attention after an
official rally led by East German leader Erich Honecker on Jan. 17
to honor German Communist Party founders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl
Liebknecht.
   Members of the Zion Church tried to join the rally in a protest
action against the nation's leadership.
   At least 100 dissidents were arrested, and more than 60 of them
have since been expelled to West Germany. The rest have also been
released from East German jails.
   The Zion Church, which is located only about two blocks from the
Berlin Wall, turned into a magnet of dissent last year when its
outspoken followers, mostly between the ages of 20 to 35, began
calling for more human rights and democracy in East Germany.
   There are no official estimates on the number of active
dissidents gathering in East Berlin's 90 Lutheran churches, but
informed sources put the number at several thousand.
   Another of the churches is the Church of Faith located near East
Germany's secret police headquarters.
   Although the movement has been gaining strength since at least
1983, it was galvanized by two events in the Soviet Union _
Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985 and the Chernobyl nuclear fire in
1986.
   Gorbachev's policies which call for some decentralization of
economic and political life have been hailed by East German
dissidents as the first good thing to come from the Soviet Union in
decades.
   While an international disaster, the April, 1986 Chernobyl fire
has also had its political uses _ alllowing those concerned with
ecological issues to rally around an issue.
   ``Chernobyl was the biggest boost for the movement,'' said Karl
Wegner, another church member who also used an alias to avoid
police harassment.
   ``People interested in ecological questions started to go to
meetings in church basements, because they soon found out the
church reacted to their demand for a room,'' he said.
   Incidents in East Germany have further aided the movement.
   On Oct. 17, a group of about 20 ``skinheads'' _ disenchanted
rightist youths _ raided a rock concert in the Zion Church and beat
up concert-goers with bicycle chains and clubs.
   Some sources say East German authorities fomented the attack,
while East Germany claims provocateurs from West Berlin were
involved.
   ``After the battle of Zion things really got hot here,'' said
Mayer, speeking in the sleet near the 115-year-old church.
   But things could get hotter.
   Party leader Honecker indicated Friday that East Germany won't
copy reforms being implemented in the Soviet Union.
   ``Of course we follow developments in the Soviet Union and the
other socialist countries very closely,'' Honecker said in a speech
to party officials carried on the state-run news agency ADN. ``But
that does not necessarily mean we intend to copy them.''
   Such a lack of tolerance could mean more crackdowns.
   Mayer says millions of East Germans watching West German
televiion have followed the progress of the dissident movement.
That's led to an inundation of queries from people who simply want
to leave and are looking for advice.
   But Mayer said his group does not want to become too involved
with those people. His concern is with those who have to stay.
   At the Zion church, the movement's resources are meager: a
10-foot-by-14-foot room in a parish building and a basement
``ecology library.''
   About 1,000 books line the shelves of the small windowless
library. Next to Joseph Stalin's ``Thoughts on Leninism'' is a copy
of the officially banned West Berlin newspaper ``Tageszeitung.''
   East Germany police raided the library in November, confiscating
duplicating machines and publications critical of government
policies.
   That raid resulted in 21 arrests, and dissident groups staged
peaceful demonstrations several days running at Zion and other East
Berlin churches until their comrades were released from prison.
   Upon leaving the building, Wegner pointed down the street at two
dour-looking police officers.
   ``Never mind them,'' he says. ``They're always here.''
